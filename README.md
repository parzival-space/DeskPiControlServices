## Supported Cases
This list contains all currently supported DeskPi cases:

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> I will try my best to support as many cases as possible, but I do not own every DeskPi case (and probably never will) 
> so some cases will remain untested. If you have one of the cases marked as 'Not Tested' please feel free to provide 
> feedback.
